# **Introduction**
Recreating Centipede served as an excercise to practice application of Object Oriented Programming, as it utilizes inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation across many classes and objects. In this Description I plan to go over attributes of my Centipede program as well as the many ways I used design patterns to increase effciency.

## Design Patterns Used
Singletons - Used across multiple systems including Mushroom Manager, Factories, and Score

Simple Factories - Used to manage the production of characters and objects

Strategy Pattern - Used to manage game modes and sound settings (mute and not mute)

Finite State Machine - Used to control the Centipede movements

Command Pattern - Used to manage Score and Sound systems

Flyweight Pattern - Used to manage and access the font
